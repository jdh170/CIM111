					at the University of Miami Frost School of Music.</p>
				<p class="bio-info">Jillian started singing and dancing at an early age and continued to foster those passions in musical theater. At the age of 12 she found a creative outlet in songwriting. She wrote, recorded, and released her
					first song titled, “Take It Slow” in 2013. Following the release, she began writing more often and released her first EP, “Seventeen” in 2016, as well as a music video for her song “Trouble.” Throughout high school, Jillian
					participated in school talent shows, coffeehouses, a cappella groups, and songwriting camps. She had the honor of performing the National Anthem at two Celtics games, as well as numerous high school and college sports games. She
					studied guitar for three years and is self-taught on piano. As she exited high school, Jillian released her second EP, “Tongue-Tied” in 2017 and a music video for the featured track, “Crazy.”</p>
				<p class="bio-info">Currently enrolled at the University of Miami Frost School of Music with a major in Musicianship, Artistry Development, and Entreprenuership (MADE), as well as minors in Music Business & Entertainment Studies,
					Creative American Music, and Marketing, Jillian has been working on multiple projects. She is an active member of BisCaydence, an internationally-acclaimed a Cappella group on campus, and was awarded Outstanding Soloist at the
					ICCA 2018 South Quarterfinal. She’s written a number of songs over her first three years, one of which was awarded second place in the Pop Rock category of the Eventide Songwriting Competition. She released two singles, “Insomnia”
					and “Maybe This Time,” in 2019.</p>
